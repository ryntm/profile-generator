# Developer Profile Generator

This CLI app will create a simple profile PDF that will highlight a developer's information on github.

To start the app type 'node index' in the 'Develop' folder

The app will then ask which user you want to create a profile for, and then a color theme that you'd like for the PDF to have. 

If the app ran successfully, you will see the PDF in the PDF folder with the username as the name of the file.
